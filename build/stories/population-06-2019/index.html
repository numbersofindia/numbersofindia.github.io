                        Being humans, curiosity is all but natural to us. We’re especially curious about people. People
                        who
                        look similar to us, people who look different than us, and people who wear funny hats. Those are
                        the
                        most intriguing. We gossip, we chant, we cheer and we praise. We’re constantly entering and
                        exiting
                        tribes, reevaluating allies and hierarchies. At some level, we consider India to be a tribe,
                        which
                        is why we function together (almost, tch). We increasingly rely on social media and the news to
                        tell
                        us what someone who’s thousands of kilometers away, yet belongs to our tribe, is thinking. This
                        is
                        vitally important to make sense of everything happening around us. The media (Whatsapp messages,
                        Republic news, etc) can often be very misleading. Really, I understand your shock. Leaders with
                        low
                        approval ratings get elected, movies that unleash religious outrage go on to break box-office
                        records (Ha!), movies that treat women like crap also go on to make a lot of money (Hmm, wut?),
                        videos go viral, restaurants go broke and twitter is always angry. Who are these people? Who is
                        an
                        Indian? This is an effort to answer where and how we exist, as a population. The next time
                        you see a report about “Middle Aged Indians wanting X”, or notice the 'national' media not
                        reporting
                        on floods in the North East, you know how many people they are, or aren't talking about. This is
                        chapter one : Geography, Age and
                        Sex.

                        India does have a lot of people. Around 1.33 Billion of them, actually, only second to China’s
                        1.38
                        Billion. Nearly 1 in every 6 humans is Indian. This number has been increasing for a while now,
                        nearly doubling over a 30 year period. While this looks like cause for concern, look at the blue
                        dotted line. That’s the number of births per woman; it’s dropped from ~6 in 1960 to ~2.3 in
                        2018.
                        The replacement rate for any population is said to be ~2.1 accounting for premature deaths. What
                        this means is that, if the births per woman drops further to ~2-2.1, Indian population will
                        stabilize. We’ll see shortly that many states in India have already hit the 2 mark and dropped
                        even
                        lower!

                        <br><br>
                        But clearly the population is not distributed uniformly across the country. It is useful to look
                        at
                        population, population density and fertility rate to get an idea of the population distribution,
                        the
                        packing and growth.

                        From first glance, it is clear that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Maharashtra have high
                        populations. This alone, however, is insufficient information to conclude if it's a problem
                        given
                        how areas of different states vary (~3000 sq. KM of Goa to ~3,00,000 sq. KM of Rajasthan). So, a
                        more insightful metric is population density which is led by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal
                        and
                        Kerala. But the most forward-looking metric is fertility rate. We already know that populations
                        where this is ~2 stabilize, and grows exponentially when it is higher. Fun fact : Kerala has a
                        very
                        low fertility rate, and a high density. Guess away, what happened there.

                        We do have to care about India as a whole, and world as a whole too, for good measure. But
                        central
                        planning has its limits. We entrust people to be able to solve their own problems. Also, slicing
                        and
                        dicing often yields better results in terms of identifying root causes and effective
                        implementation
                        of policies. What would you say if I told you that a citizen in one state has a grossly different "voting value" and effective government spending? That would be crazy, right? Yep. It would also be true.

                                The center divides revenue to states considering a bunch of complex parameters such as fiscal
                                discipline, fiscal capacity, land area, ongoing crises, etc. Though
                                this
                                formula has been tweaked by the then Planning Commission and now Niti Aayog, repeatedly, the broad
                                principles remain the same. Population remains a
                                significant factor in determining revenue share. States must receive money proportional to the number of people they govern.
                                Here's
                                the catch. The population considered for this is the population of 1971. The
                                distribution
                                then was remarkably different from the distribution now. Uttar Pradesh has grown by ~2.5x where as Kerala has grown by ~1.6x. So, states that have managed to
                                bring
                                about effective family planning have more money to spend per citizen, with all other things
                                accounted
                                for.

                                The guiding principle for dividing regions into Parliamentary Constituencies is to
                                ensure an
                                equal voice for each citizen in the parliament. Each State is given a fixed number of seats. The Lok Sabha constituencies' boundaries in each state are redrawn by the Boundary
                                Delimitation Commission of India every decade based on the Indian census, to ensure that there are more or less equal number of people per constituency. However, reevaluating the number of seats per state was suspended in 1976
                                following a constitutional amendment to incentivise the family planning programme. So given widely varied growth rates,  
                                a citizen in Bihar has "less of a vote" than a citizen in Orissa.

                        The path to fix this discrepancy, however, is riddled with difficult questions. Do we start from
                        zero again? Wouldn't that punish states that spent heavily on family planning, and reward states that didn't take the mission seriously enough? Is maintaining
                        'carrot and stick' mechanism more important than addressing actual suffering in poorer states? How to solve world peace? :(

                        [Edit : This article was trending on the homepage of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20506060">hackernews</a> on the week of its release. One of the criticisms was about the tone of this section, especially because it might seem like I'm indicating that women 'owe it' to men to marry them. I completely understand this criticism and my intention couldn't be further from it. My motivation was to highlight the effect skewed sex-ratios have on the population, as an aggregate. I abhor the thought of men acting entitled to women, and women being treated as possessions. I simply wanted to highlight the impact of sex-selection that is already being felt in countries such as China where 'family life' is taught to be a 'truth' that every human must go through. I apologise if I have offended anyone's sensibilities and shall strive to do better. :) ]

                        We all remember reading about the evils of female foeticide and infanticide in our school social
                        studies text books. What happened to that? Have we solved that issue and is there an way to
                        quantify the harm? The first number that jumps at us is the sex ratio of a country. India has
                        ~8% more males than females with a sexratio of 926 females for every 1000 males. Given probability at
                        birth is nearly 50%, we expect the sexratio to be 1 female per male. Sexratio of Indian States
                        varies between 879 of Haryana and 1084 of Kerala. The visualization above indicates number of women per 100 men, in each state. Apart from a few states, most have sexratios
                        above 900. Yay, we've hit 90%! Woohoo. Isn't this good? Unfortunately not. <br><br>

                        When we look at percentages, we often forget that the actual number of people is millions multiplied by that percentage. A more intuitive number is to calculate additional males,
                        overall. Each circle below represents 100k "extra males".
                    </p>

                        We currently have around 35 Mil 'extra men'. This number is staggering. India is a country where
                        marriage is an obvious way of life (I'm discounting LGBTQ marriages in the event they become
                        legal, as it most likely won't have much of an effect on the proportions, although it'll bring down absolute numbers). By Indian
                        culture standards, growing a family is an essential piece of an individual's life. This crisis is already
                        playing out in several parts of China. <a
                            href='https://www.ft.com/content/d44122c0-a435-11e5-873f-68411a84f346'>Chinese men actively
                            seek out partners from other countries, often saving up large sums of money for this
                            singular purpose.</a> <br><br>Also interestingly, studies show that the proportion of marriageable
                        women does not remain constant, even if sex-ratio is constant. Older men save up and end up marrying younger women eroding the next
                        generation's pool of women. So, the deficit keeps growing far into the future. There is active research into the societal implications of millions of 'barren' men in a population. Though
                        the findings are not universally accepted, there is evidence to believe that there will be
                        perceptible increase in crime and violence. Imagine millions of men, with barely enough jobs and
                        no conceivable prospect of marriage or family, the one thing they know to be central to the Indian way of life. I hope you look slightly
                        worried. Kerala to the rescue ❤️? <br><br>

                            This is the registered electors data of 2019 general elections, and is meant to be
                            relative/indicative only. You can observe that population of most constituencies in a state
                            are
                            more or less equal, however the population of states themselves, vary widely. The density plot
                            highlights
                            urban clusters of India - Delhi (NCR), Mumbai-Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and
                            Kolkata.
                            These regions are very densely populated and are administratively very different from
                            their
                            low-density counterparts. The distance-from-state-capital didn;tt turn out to be particularly insightful. But looks pretty nonetheless :)

                            One interesting indicator of development is the percentage of population in urban regions vs
                            rural regions. In urban regions, economies of scale begin aiding service-distribution. Urban
                            areas are also the hubs of trade, manufacturing and are bustling with economic activity. We
                            observe that north-west and south-west states have a higher proportion of urban population
                            compared with the rest of the nation. The total national urban population is around
                            ~30%, compared to nearly 59% in China. This is vital in addressing India's unemployment and
                            quality primary education woes.

                        The average Indian is 27 years old (median is around 25). Ah, to be young and foolish. That must
                        be it, right? The above plot is the distribution of age for rural and urban, male and female
                        populations. Notice that states with high fertility rates have a nearly exponentially decreasing
                        curve, whereas the others have a more plateaued region before the drop.

                        Hopefully by now you have a fair understanding of where "India resides". Gender is always tricky
                        to deal with. There's not enough data to map out transgender folks, apologies for that. Also I may have used male-female interchangably with men-women, again because the data doesn't really differentiate. The
                        issue of representative equality (and possibly economic equality) will come up for review in
                        2026. The impact of missing women is already upon us. The first step in solving these issues is
                        looking at them. Over snacks and pretty graphs, of course :)<br><br>Do shoot your thoughts and criticisms at me! And
                        stay tuned for Chapter 2! Taaata!
